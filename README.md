# Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Parth and I'm expecting to graduate from General Assembly in Janurary of 2024. Prior to that, I earned my undergraduate and graduate degrees in Biomedical Engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Techonology in 2019 and 2022 respectively. After spending 3 years in the medical device industry, I decided to make a career change into software engineering after discovering a deep fascination with the programming involved to make these devices work as intended. I'm currently looking for a full-time position as a software engineer.

<a href="https://main--parthvachhaniportfolio.netlify.app/">View my Portfolio!</a> I made this basic rough draft of how I would want my porfolio to look using React and JSX. I do plan to have future iterations of this portfolio which would involve making it a single-page scrollable portfolio, a better color palette for light mode, and more animations.

Shoutout to AyyazTech (https://www.youtube.com/@AyyazTech) for the guides on dark mode and light mode functionality and image carousels for the projects.
