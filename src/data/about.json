	"bio": "Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Parth and I'm expecting to graduate from General Assembly in Janurary of 2024. Prior to that, I earned my undergraduate and graduate degrees in Biomedical Engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Techonology in 2019 and 2022 respectively. After spending 3 years in the medical device industry, I decided to make a career change into software engineering after discovering a deep fascination with the programming involved to make these devices work as intended. I'm currently looking for a full-time position as a software engineer.",
