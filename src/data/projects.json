        "bio": "Welcome to Mastermind! Mastermind is originally a two-player code breaking board game that was invented by Mordecai Meirowitz in 1970, and is based off another game called Bulls and Cows which is played using paper and pencil. This rendition is a single-player version where the player is tasked with cracking a randomly generated code using their deductive reasoning skills by interpreting the hints given to them as the game progresses. Click the link above to play, or visit the GitHub repository to view the code. Have fun!",
